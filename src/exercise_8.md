# Exercise 8

## 1. complete

1. In test pyramid, **(`.....`)** and **(`.....`)** level tests are automated and created using **(`.....`)** tools. At **(`.....`)** and **(`.....`)** levels, automated tests are created using **(`.....`)** tools.
2. Testing quadrants apply to **(`.....`)** testing only.
3. **(`.....`)** strategies can be used by the testers in Agile teams to help determine the acceptable number of test cases to execute.
4. Iteration starts with iteration **(`.....`)** which ends in tasks on a task board. These tasks can be **(`.....`)** in part based on level of **(`.....`)** associated with them. The aim is to know which tasks should start **(`.....`)** and involve more **(`.....`)** effort.
5. During iteration planning, team assesses each identified risk, which includes two activities: **(`.....`)** and determining **(`.....`)** based on **(`.....`)** and **(`.....`)**
6. Information from the **(`.....`)** is used during poker planning sessions to determine priorities of items to be completed in the **(`.....`)**
7. The main part of the lifecycle cost often comes from **(`.....`)** .


>> 1. **(`unit - integration - api based - system - acceptance - gui-based`)**
>> 2. **(`dynamic`)**
>> 3. **(`Risk identification, analysis, and risk mitigation`)**
>> 4. **(`planning - prioritized -quality risks - earlier - testing`)**
>> 5. **(`categorizing risks - its level of risk - impact - the likelihood of defects`)**
>> 6. **(`risk analysis - iteration`)**
>> 7. **(`maintenance after the product have been released`)**

## 2. replace with key terms

1. is the first iteration of the project where many preparation activities take place.
2. Each team member brings a different set of skills to the team. The team works together on test strategy, planning, specification, execution, evaluation, and results reporting.
3. The team may consist only of developers, ideally there would be one or more testers.
4. Testers sit together with the developers and the product owner.
5. Testers collaborate with team members (stakeholders, product owner, Scrum Master).
6. Technical decisions regarding design and testing are made by the team as a whole.
7. The tester is committed to question and evaluate the product’s behaviour and characteristics with respect to the expectations and needs of the customers and users.
8. Development and testing progress is visible on the Agile task board.
9. The tester must ensure the credibility of the strategy for testing, its implementation, and execution, otherwise the stakeholders will not trust the test results.
10. Retrospectives allow teams to learn from successes and from failures.
11. Testing must be able to respond to change, like all other activities in Agile projects.
12. Externally observable behaviour with user actions as input operating under certain configurations.
13. How the system performs the specified behaviour. Referred to as quality attributes or non-functional requirements.
14. A sequence of actions between an external actor (often a user) and the system, in order to accomplish a specific goal or business task.
15. Activities that can only be performed in the system under certain conditions defined by outside procedures and constraints.
16. Between system and outside world.
17. Design and implementation constraint that will restrict the options for the developer such as embedded software respecting physical constraints such as size, weight.
18. The customer may describe the format, data type, allowed values, and default values for a data item in the composition of a complex business data structure.
19. communication tool allows teams to build and share an online knowledge base on tools and techniques for development and testing activities.
20. are used to store source code and automated tests, manual tests and other test work products in same repository.
21. Tools that generate data to populate an application’s database are very beneficial when a lot of data and combinations of data are necessary to test the application.
22. Manual data entry is often time consuming and error prone, but data load tools are available to make the process reliable and efficient.
23. Specific tools are available to support test-first approaches, such as BDD, TDD, ATDD.
24. Tools capture and log activities performed on an application during an exploratory test session
25. how many defects are found per day or per  transaction
26. number of defects found compared to number of user stories, effort, and/or quality attributes
27. provides the test conditions to cover during a time-boxed testing session.
28. uninterrupted period of testing, could last from 60-120 mints
