# Exercise 1

## 1. Compare QA and QC in respect of focus and assessment measures/tools

|                    | QC (repair defects)               | QA (early detection)                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| focus              | product quality at a given moment | project process (process oriented)  |
| character          | reactive(detect issues)           | preventive(block issues)            |
| starting point     | requirement gathering             | project planning                    |
| tools and measures | testing, test metrics and reports | quality metrics, reviews and audits |

## 2. Objectivity in process quality assurance evaluations is critical to success of project. List four objective evaluation methods.

- independent QA organization
- independent reviewers
- standard criteria
- checklist

## 3. Mention four benefits of software quality assurance.

- sqa is a cost-effective investment
- increases customers trust
- improves the product's safety and reliability
- lower the expense of maintenance
- guards against system failure

## 4. Explain what is meant by PDCA/Deming cycle.

> well defined cycle for quality assurance

## 5. An agile project using Scrum has many opportunities to objectively evaluate ceremonies and work products. Describe three opportunities.

- user stories are examined
- scrum master coaches the team
- feedbacks on what was built
- management or peers observe Scrum ceremonies

## 6. Process tailoring is a critical activity that allows controlled changes to the processes due to the specific needs of a project or a part of the organization. Mention three reasons for process tailoring.

- Accommodating the process to a new solution
- Adapting the process to a new work environment
- Modifying the process description, so that it can be used within a given project
- Adding more detail to the process to address a unique solution or constraint
- Modifying, replacing, or reordering process elements

## 7. List four examples of organizational process assets.

- templates
- plans
- best practices
- approved methods
- guidelines

## 8. Identify three similarities between QA and QC.

- both are critical components of its quality management strategy.
- improve a companyâ€™s product manufacturing process
- intend to cut expenses

## 9. Mention three quality assurance work products

- Criteria
- Checklists
- Evaluation reports
- Noncompliance reports
- Improvement proposals

## 10. replace with key term

1. Problems identified when team members do not follow applicable standards, recorded processes, or procedures
2. Quality assurance process to develop processes to reduce defects by avoiding or correcting
3. Proven set of global best practices that drives business performance through benchmark key capabilities
4. Ongoing process that ensures software product meets and complies with organization's established and standardized quality specifications
5. Tangible resources used by an organization to guide the management of its projects and operations
6. A process-level improvement training and appraisal program
7. Proven set of global best practices that drives business performance through building and benchmarking key capabilities
8. refers to how effectively a software product adheres to the core design specifications based on functional standards
9. how effectively the project satisfies non-functional standards, including security, accessibility, scalability, and reliability, all of which contribute to the proper fulfillment of the predetermined requirements
10. defines the structures necessary to contain the processes, process assets, and connections
11. The physical structure or framework for organizing the content
12. Reflects how the data is organized with in the structural architecture
13. It is critical activity that allows controlled changes to the processes
14. focuses on satisfaction of requirement
15. ensures that the product works as intended in its target environment

- Service establishment and management (CMMI-SVC)
- Product and service acquisition (CMMI-ACQ)
