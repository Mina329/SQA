# Exercise 2

## 1. The aim of 5 whys root cause analysis is to find the main technical causes behind the problem


- it aims to inspect a certain problem in depth until it shows you real cause
- often, issues that are considered a technical problem actually turn out to be human and process problems.
- avoid answers that are too simple / overlook important details.
- it is used for defects reported from a customer site

## 2. When to perform causal analysis? Which factors affect decision of effort and formality required?

- `when`
  > - during the task when problem or successes warrant [`تستدعي`] a causal analysis
  > - work product significantly deviates [`ينحرف`]
  > - more defects
  > - process performance exceeds expectations
  > - process does not meet its quality
- `factors`
  > - **stakeholders**
  > - risks
  > - complexity
  > - frequency
  > - availability of data

## 3. Identify elements of process improvement proposal.

for changes proven to be effective

- areas that were analyzed including their context
- solution selection
- actions achieved
- results achieved

## 4. Discuss advantages of PCDA approach.

- stimulate continuous improvement
- test possible solutions
- prevent from recurring mistakes

## 5. Defining the problem is an important step in root cause analysis. Explain the rule that should be followed in defining the problem.

1. define the problem
2. collect data
3. identify possible causal factors
4. identify the root cause
5. recommend and implement solutions

> Defining the problem
  > > **SMART Rules**
  > > > - ` S -> Specific`
  > > > - ` M -> Measurable`
  > > > - ` A -> Attainable`
  > > > - ` R -> Relevant`
  > > > - ` T -> Time bound`

## 6. Describe four types of costs of quality.

- `cost of good quality`
  - prevention cost
    > prevent poor quality in products
  - appraisal cost
    > measure, inspect, evaluate products to assure conformance to quality requirements
- `cost of poor quality`
  - internal failure cost
    > when a product fails to conform to quality specification before shipment to customer
  - external failure cost
    > when a product fails to conform to quality specification after shipment to customer

## 7. Identify steps of internal audit process.

- planning the audit scheduling
- planning the process audit
- conducting the audit
- reporting the audit
- follow up on issue or implements found

## 8. Explain roles in RACI model.

- responsible
  - > ensure right things happen in the right time
- accountable
  - > ensure that something gets done correctly
- consult
  - > people who need to be consulted
- inform
  - > need to be kept informed

## 9. List three benefits and limitations of cost of quality system.

- `benefits`
  > - higher profitability
  > - more consistent products
  > - greater customer satisfaction
  > - lower costs
  > - meeting industry standard
  > - increase staff motivation
  > - reducing waste
- `limitations`
  > - measuring quality costs does not solve quality problems
  > - CoQ is merely a scoreboard for current performance
  > - inability to quantify the hidden quality costs (hidden factory)

## 12. A company’s website redesign would require design and development teams to work on tasks concurrently. Each task would affect work in sales, marketing, finance and business development. Structural changes, timelines and major costs would require input and approval from senior management.Needs can be easily overlooked and requirements dropped in such complex projects.What should the project manager create to avoid missing important details and ensure clear communication throughout the project?
