# Lecture 2

# 1. CMMI casual analysis and resolution

> identify causes of selected outcomes and take action to improve
> process performance

- agile team that is consistently unable to complete the work defined for each sprint would look for
  > - chornic distractions
  > - using unreliable velocity data
  > - poorly defined user stories
  > - exceeding team capacity
  > - understanding complxeity

## 1.2 when to apply causal analysis?

- during the task when problem or successes warrant [`تستدعي`] a causal analysis
- work product significantly deviates [`ينحرف`]
- more defects
- process performance exceeds expectations
- process does not meet its quality

## 1.3 factors of efforts required for causal analysis

- stakeholders
- risks
- complexity
- frequency
- availability of data

# 2. root case analysis (RCA)

> cmmi mechanism of analyzing the defects to identify its cause
> it helps to prevent defects in the later releases

## 2.1 type of root causes

1. human cause (_under skilled_)
2. organizational cause (_vague [`غامض`] instructions given by team lead, monitoring tools not in place to assess the quality_)
3. physical cause (_computer keep restaring_)

## 2.2 RCA facilitator

- ensure no blame approach
- ensure team focas on solutions not problems
- provide training
- ensure info captured into rca document

## 2.3 how to perform RCA

1. define the problem using `smart` rules
2. collect data
3. identify possible causal factors
4. identify the root cause
5. recommend and implement solutions

## 2.4 RCA tools

- brainstorming
- 5 whys
- fishbone diagram
- scatter plots
- pareto chart
- FMEA

### 2.4.1 brainstorming

> is a group process in which everyone gives an idea in rotation until
> next round to collect different viewpoints
>
> > `challenges`
> >
> > - wrong root cause may be selected without evidence and structured way to analyze
> > - will not get beyond the collective knowledge of the team

### 2.4.2 5 whys

> - it aims to inspect a certain problem in depth until it shows you real cause.
> - Avoid answers that are too simple / overlook important details.

- whys

### 2.4.3 fishbone diagram

> known as the cause and effect diagram
>
> > shows the problem at the head of the fish-like looking diagram and the backbone with major factors

- `steps`
  > 1. write the problem at the haed of the fish
  > 2. identify the category of causes and write at end of each bone
  > 3. identify the primary cause under each category
  > 4. extend the causes to secondary, teriary, ...

### 2.4.4 scatter plots

> visual representations of a relationship between 2 sets of data to test correlation between variable

### 2.4.5 pareto chart

> bar graph that groups the frequency distribution to show the relative significance of causes of failure
>
> > `80% of effects` come from `20% of causes` (`pareto principle`)

### 2.4.6 FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis)

> method used during the product design to identify potential problems and solve them

- failure modes
  - identifies all the ways that a problem could occur
- effects analysis
  - evalute the causes and consequences of each failure mode

> A `Severity Occurrence and Detection (SOD)` rating to calculate risk and determine the next steps

# 3. addressing causes

- changing the process to remove error-prone steps
- updating a process based on previous sucessess
- eliminating non-value-added task
- automating all or part of the process
- adding process steps

## 3.1 actional proposal

## 3.2 action plans

implement the selected action proposals
includes:

- people responsible
- description of the action
- description of necessary tasks
- description effected areas
- effected stakeholders
- cost

## 3.3 process improvement proposals

for changes proven to be effective

- areas that were analyzed including their context
- solution selection
- actions achieved
- results achieved

# 4. international standard

## 4.1 internal audit

- organization shall conduct internal audit to provide info whether the quality management system
  > - confirms to
  >   - organization's own requirements
  >   - international standard requirements
  > - is effectivly maintained and implemented

### 4.1. internal audit steps

- planning the audit scheduling
- planning the process audit
- conducting the audit
- reporting the audit
- follow up on issue or implements found

## 4.2. management reviews

### 4.2.1 management reviews input

- status of actions
- changes in external and internal issues
- information on the performance
- the effectiveness of actions

### 4.2.2 management reviews outputs

- opportunities for improvements
- any need for changes
- resource needs

### 4.2.3 improvements

- product and service
- correcting and preventing
- performance and effectiveness

### 4.2.4 nonconformity and corrective action

- react to the nonconformity and, as applicable
- evaluate the need for action to eliminate the cause(s) of nonconformity
- implement any action needed;
- review the effectiveness of any corrective action taken
- update risks and opportunities determined during planning
- make changes to the quality management system, if necessary.

### 4.2.5 continuous improvement

by PDCA (plan-do-check-act)

# 5. PDCA

> cycle that is useful too that help the teams to solve problem efficiently

adv

- stimulate continuous improvement
- test possible solutions
- prevent from recurring mistakes

# 6. RACI model/matrix

> shows how each person contributes to a project

- responsible
  - > ensure right things happen in the right time
- accountable
  - > ensure that something gets done correctly
- consult
  - > people who need to be consulted
- inform
  - > need to be kept informed

# 7. cost of equality (CoQ)

> method for calculating the costs

- `cost of good quality`
  - prevention cost
    > prevent poor quality in products
  - appraisal cost
    > measure, inspect, evalute products to assure conformance to quality requirements
- `cost of poor quality`
  - internal failure cost
    > when a product fails to conform to quality specification before shipment to customer
  - external failure cost
    > when a product fails to conform to quality specification after shipment to customer

## 7.1 goal & benefits of CoQ

> cost of poor equality (COPQ)
>
> > costs that are generated as a result of producing defective material

## 7.2 CoQ benefits

- higher profitability
- more consistent products
- greater customer satisfaction
- lower costs
- meeting industry standard
- increase staff motivation
- reducing waste

## 7.3 CoQ limitation

- measuring quality costs does not solve quality problems
- CoQ is merely a scoreboard for current performance
- inability to quantify the hidden quality costs (hidden factory)

> `hidden factory` represent the percentage of an organizations total capacity or effort that is being used to overcome the cost of poor qualit
