# Lecture 1

# 1. software quality

> ongoing process that ensures the software product meets and compiles
> with the organizatons's established and standarized quality specifications

> make sures that the product has met its specification

- software function quality
  > how effectively a software product adheres to the core design based on functional standards
- software structural quality
  > how effectively the product satisfy non-functional standards

> PDCA (deming cycle)
>
> > well defined cycle for quality assurance
> >
> > - plan
> > - do
> > - check
> > - act

## 1.1 benefits of SQA ?

- sqa is a cost-effective investment
- increases customers trust
- improves the product's safty and reliability
- lower the expense of maintenance
- gaurds against system failure

# 2. quality assurance vs quality control

|                    | QC (repair defects)               | QA (early detection)                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| focus              | product quality                   | project process (process oriented)  |
| character          | reactive(detect issues)           | preventive(block issues)            |
| starting point     | requirement gathering             | project planning                    |
| tools and measures | testing, test metrics and reports | quality metrics, reviews and audits |

# 3. capability maturity model integration (CMMI)

is a process-level improvement training and appraiseal program

> set of global best practices that drives business
> performance through building and benchmarking key
> capabilities.

> it defines the following maturity levels for processes
>
> - intial
> - managed
> - defined
> - quantitively managed
> - optimizing

## 3.1 CMMI addresses three area of interests

- product and service development
- service stablishment
- product and service acquisition

# 4. process quality assurance (PQA)

**involves:**

- objectively evaluating performed processes, work products against the applicable process descriptions, standards, and procedures
- identifying and documenting noncompliance issues
- providing feedback to project staff and managers on the results of quality assurance activities

**evaluated objectively by objectivity by**

- independent QA organizaton
- independent reviewers
- standard criterias
- checklist

**objective evaluation methods**

- formal audits
- peer reviews
- in-depth review of work in place where it's performed
- distributed reviews
- built-in or automated process checks

## 4.1 poka-yoke mechanism

> quality assurance process to develop processes to reduce defects
> by avoiding or correcting mistakes in early decign development phases

categories of poka-yoke

- defect prevention
- defect detection

examples of work products

- Criteria
- Checklists
- Evaluation reports
- Noncompliance reports
- Improvement proposals

> `noncompliance issues`
>
> > are problems identified with the team members don't follow applicable standards, recorded process or procedures

# 5. quality assurance

includes

- evaluating the process
- identifying ways that the proceess can be improved
- submitting improvement proposals

## 5.1 QA in scrum

has many opportunities for objective evaluation

- user stories are examined
- scrum master coaches the team
- feadbacks on what was built
- management or peers observe Scrum ceremonies

## 5.2 PQA in agile

- release planing
- backlog grooming
- sprint planing
- sprint execution
- sprint revie
- retrospective

# 6. process assets development

> are tangible resources used by an organization to guide the management of its project and operations
>
> > examples
> >
> > - templates
> > - plans
> > - best practices
> > - approved methods
> > - guidelines

## 6.1 process assets in agile

developed in sprint 0 to collect refinment suggestions

# 7. process architecture

defines the structures to contain the processes

aspects

- structural architecture
  - the physical structure or framework for organizing the content
- content architecture
  - reflect how the data is organized within the structural architecture

# 8. steps to update process assets

- verify the organizational's set of standard processes
- review and decide if the recommendations will be incorporated

## 8.1 process adaptation/tailoring

> is critical activity that allow controlled changes to the processes

- `reasones for tailoring`
  > - Accommodating the process to a new solution
  > - Adapting the process to a new work environment
  > - Modifying the process description, so that it can be used within a given project
  > - Adding more detail to the process to address a unique solution or constraint
  > - Modifying, replacing, or reordering process elements

# 9. work environment standards

> allow the organization and projects to benefit from common tools, training, maintenance, and cost savings

# 10. QA relation to validation & verification

> verification
>
> > satisfaction of requirements
>
> validation
>
> > product works as intended
